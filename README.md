This is a personal portfolio that I created for myself, titled "Nefelibata".

Nefelibata, (n.) lit. "cloud walker"; one who lives in the clouds of their own imagination, or one who does not obey by the conventions of society, literature, or art

I created this portfolio not only as a way of tracking my skills and expertise, but also as a way for me to keep track of my projects and progress within my engineering journy.
